## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS Framework
- Vanilla JS

### What I learned

This project was mostly an opportunity to tackle a slightly more complex JavaScript project. I learned about how to fetch JSON formatted data from an API and display it on my website.

### Continued development

I would like to continue tackling Javascript projects as I feel that my grasp on Tailwind is already quite good at this point.

### Useful resources

- [freeCodeCamp - JSON API's and AJAX](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-visualization/#json-apis-and-ajax) - This is where I learned how to use the fetch method to get JSON data from an API
